Hi! Thanks for visiting my page. I'm perzarys (he/him). I work in Geoinformatics (M.Sc.) and Remote Sensing. You might know me from some digital privacy communities, like CalyxOS, where I'm also active as community moderator.

In case you want to contact me, please use PGP (see [Keyoxide](https://keyoxide.org/61FE4D7E8643BFB9786445F371F47198A9714286)) when sending me an e-mail to [perzarys@mailbox.org](mailto:perzarys@mailbox.org), or ideally send me a message on Matrix  at ```@perzarys:matrix.org```.
