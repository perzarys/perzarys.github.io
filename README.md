# Hi! I'm perzarys. 

Welcome to my small space on the internet! I do some things here. Not a lot though. Feel free to look around.

I work in Geoinformatics (M.Sc.) and Remote Sensing. You might know me from some digital privacy communities, like CalyxOS, where I'm also active as community moderator.
Things

- CalyOS-related things
    - CalyxOS Version Lookup
    - CalyxOS IMS Table

Otherwise, I will write very short text passages here every now and then. Probably about things that I noticed not yet having enough attention elsewhere on the internet.
