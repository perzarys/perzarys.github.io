Welcome to my small space on the internet! I do some things here. Not a lot though. Feel free to look around.

I work in Geoinformatics (M.Sc.) and Remote Sensing. You might know me from some digital privacy communities, like CalyxOS, where I'm also active as community moderator.
Things

- CalyOS-related things
    - [CalyxOS Version Lookup](https://perzarys.github.io/calyxos-version-lookup/)
    - [CalyxOS IMS Table](https://gist.github.com/perzarys/e97c1a19798e9b80ecdd5397b192e018)

Otherwise, I will write very short text passages here every now and then. Probably about things that I noticed not yet having enough attention elsewhere on the internet.
